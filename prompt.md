We are India’s Biggest Transformational Festival
Welcome to Bloom In Green

Step into a space where music, movement, and community weave together in harmony. Here, we gather to create, express, connect and bloom.

BIG is more than a festival; it’s an imaginative, open society where people come as they are, and leave with deeper bonds, cherished memories, and a renewed connection to nature and self.
